# Indiana Jones - Fertility Idol Altar
This is the code that connects the PN532 RFID reader, activates the linear actuator and can also communicate with other devices with RFM69 packet radio

Plan for all devices to run on Raspberry Pi Pico based boards with RFM69 packet radios, currently using:
Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM69 Packet Radio (868 or 915 MHz)
- https://www.adafruit.com/product/5712

- Pi zero -> runs altar_pn532.py which drives the PN532 RFID reader, controls linear actuator and sends commands to other devices with ESP322 radio
- Pi 3 -> runs listen-act.py, which receives the RFID key tag string via ESP322 and can then act based on this tag

Working on using Github Desktop

Wiring diagram and moduels used on Pi zero
- runs altar_pn532.py which drives the PN532 RFID reader, controls linear actuator and sends commands to other devices with ESP322 radio

Other libraries required:
  - adafruit_pn532
  - circuitpython_nrf24l01 (folder) (https://github.com/nRF24/CircuitPython_nRF24L01)

Tips for use of Git / Github:
- Git commit -am “commit notes”
- Git push origin main   # pushes changes on pi’s to GitHub
- Git pull origin main  # pulls or gets files from Github to pi

- BIG CHANGES!!!!!
